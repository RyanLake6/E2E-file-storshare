CLI tool meant to E2E store and share files and easily share, built with nextcloud

So why did I make this? Well... nextcloud seems to have server side ecryption but with the default encryption module they provide once you starts encrypting all uploaded data and you can't unencrypt it. Server side encryption takes more time and more space for all files once turned on. So what if you wanted to encrypt some things but not others? Or you don't fully trust their encryption and want to encrypt ontop of theirs as well for very secure documents? This is the solution!

Also what if you want to quickly upload a file or share a file without going through their UI? Well... this tool would allow you to use quick commands to get a shareable link. It would also give easy commands to share the link through third party tools to sms or email to a colleauge.

_TLDR_: I'm making this to provide users with more options and ease of use
